Once upon a time there were a bunch of restless students who created a group called the Milk-Chugging Teens.
They were all passionate about memes so they created together a facebook page called memes for Milk-Chugging Teens where they aspired to post a meme about their university every single weekend.
One student in the group named Nick, a Computer Science major, was especially passionate about making CS-related memes. 
He searched and searched for CS memes ideas but couldn't find anything.

Nick tried very, very hard to think of CS memes, but he was having a very hard time.  Nick never really paid attention any of his CS courses.
With his struggles to make CS memes, Nick finally realized that he doesnt really understand any of the content in his CS courses.  
Nick was lead to an epiphony that he must become super knowledgable about CS to make the best CS memes.
