Once upon a time there were a bunch of restless students who created a group called the Milk-Chugging Teens.
They were all passionate about memes so they created together a facebook page called memes for Milk-Chugging Teens where they aspired to post a meme about their university every single weekend.
One student in the group named Nick, a Computer Science major, was especially passionate about making CS-related memes. 
He searched and searched for CS memes ideas but couldn't find anything.

Nick tried very, very hard to think of CS memes, but he was having a very hard time.  Nick never really paid attention any of his CS courses.
With his struggles to make CS memes, Nick finally realized that he doesnt really understand any of the content in his CS courses.  
Nick was lead to an epiphony that he must become super knowledgable about CS to make the best CS memes.

Nick eventually posted a meme about for loop time complexity, and he got over 100 like and 100 reactions on facebook.
He was riding on that high feeling, good and started to create more content. 
He hopes that soon enough he'll be a top creator on the page!

Nick spent hours refining his craft, perfecting his meme mastery
The number of likes on his memes continued to rise with every post.
He surpassed his peers easily.

When Nick learned about the improved time complexity with hash table, he got so excited so he spent over 8 hours perfecting his ~best~ meme about hash table complexity.
He posted it on the Facebook meme page, and people loved it instantly.
Nick was so elated because his dream was finally achieved to be the meme-master, that he went into a stroke and died. His last words were: I came, I saw, and I conquered to make memes!!

La Fin.
