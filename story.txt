Once upon a time there were a bunch of restless students who created a group called the Milk-Chugging Teens. They were all passionate about memes so they created together a facebook page called memes for Milk-Chugging Teens where they aspired to post a meme about their university every single weekend. One student in the group named Nick, a Computer Science major, was especially passionate about making CS-related memes. He searched and searched for CS memes ideas but couldn't find anything.
